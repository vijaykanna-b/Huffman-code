# Huffman-code


Message Compression reduces the size of the string significantly. It is useful in situation like Communication over low bandwidth channels.
                 Standard Encoding schemes such as, ASCII or UNICODE uses fixed length binary strings to encode character (8 bits for ASCII & 16 bits for UNICODE). Whereas Huffman Coding uses variable length encoding optimise for the particular string “X”. The Optimisation is based on the character frequencies. The frequency represents the number of a character appears in the string.
